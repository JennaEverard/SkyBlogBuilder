## How to Use

#### The fourth and final page is where users have the option of tying their blog post to their Handshake domain. A series of steps are provided and the exact input for the DNS record they must add to their domain is provided based on the previously generated Skylink. A user can also type their handshake name into the input box which allows the application to provide them with their newly customized link to their blog post (that will work as soon as their DNS record changes sync!)
